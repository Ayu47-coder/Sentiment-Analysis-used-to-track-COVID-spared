# 🌍 COVID-19 Sentiment Analysis Using Twitter Data

## 📝 Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the **sentiments of people** regarding **COVID-19** across different countries using **Twitter data**.  
The goal is to understand how public sentiment correlates with the **spread of the virus** and how emotional reactions varied during different stages of the pandemic.

By leveraging **social media sentiment**, we can gain insights into:
- Public perception and awareness
- Levels of fear, anxiety, and optimism
- Potential links between sentiment trends and COVID-19 case spikes

  Tweets related to COVID-19 are collected across different countries.

- 🧹 **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Cleaning tweets (removing URLs, mentions, hashtags, special characters)
  - Lowercasing and tokenization
  - Removing stopwords and irrelevant words

- 🔍 **Sentiment Analysis**:
  - Calculating **polarity** and **subjectivity** using TextBlob
  - Classifying tweets into **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral** sentiments
